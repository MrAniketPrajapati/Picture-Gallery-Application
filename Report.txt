I have created a Picture Gallery application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript , API calls.

In the "index.html" file, I've structured the body section with a header and a main section. Inside the main section, i have placed a div tag. Following the main section, I've included a script source link.

Within the header tag, I have used an h1 tag as the largest heading, and  added the text "Picture Gallery." Additionally,  included an input element with specified attributes like type, id, and placeholder.

In the main section, created four buttons labeled "All," "Landscape," "Food," and "Animals."

When writing the CSS code, I encountered some challenges, such as determining the appropriate values for properties like padding, margin, and width to ensure that the images are displayed correctly.

In the JavaScript code, i have declared constants like gallery, searchInput, and categoryButtons. also used functions, arrays, for-each loops, conditional statements (if-else), and event listeners to manipulate the gallery and handle user interactions.

Overall, i have built a functional picture gallery application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and  faced some typical challenges in the process.
